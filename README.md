# AWS-Intro



To know what is AWS, first we should know :

What is cloud computing? Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services -- from applications to storage and processing power -- typically over the internet and on a pay as you go basis. Rather than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider. As long as an electronic device has access to the web, it has access to the data and the software programs to run it. Cloud computing services cover a vast range of options now, from the basics of storage, networking, and processing power through to natural language processing and artificial intelligence as well as standard office applications.


Who is using cloud computing? Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world.

Advantages of Cloud Computing 
Cloud-based software offers companies from all sectors a number of benefits, including the ability to use software from any device either via an app or a browser. As a result, users can carry their files and settings over to other devices in a completely seamless manner.

Cloud computing is far more than just accessing files on multiple devices. Using cloud computing services, users can check their email on any computer and even store files using services such as Dropbox and Google Drive. Cloud computing services also make it possible for users to backup their music, files, and photos, ensuring those files are immediately available in the event of a hard drive crash. Hardware failures do not result in data loss because of networked backups. It uses remote resources, saving industries the cost of servers and other equipment.

It also offers big businesses huge cost-saving potential. Before the cloud became a viable alternative, companies were required to purchase, construct, and maintain costly information management technology and infrastructure. But now, companies can swap costly server centers and IT departments for fast Internet connections, where employees interact with the cloud online to complete their tasks.

What is AWS cloud computing?
Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 175 fully featured services from data centers globally.

AWS is trusted by many firms, small or big because of the features it provides. AWS helps companies with a wide variety of workloads such as game development, data processing, warehousing, achieve, development and many more.


AWS provides a comprehensive suite of services and solutions to run sophisticated and scalable applications to help achieve better business outcomes. Running your applications in the AWS Cloud can help you move faster, operate more securely, and save substantial costs; all while benefitting from the agility, scale and performance of the cloud.

Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world. With data center locations in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Singapore, Japan, and Australia, customers across all industries are taking advantage of the following benefits

Easy to use _AWS is designed to allow application providers, ISVs, and vendors to quickly and securely host your applications – whether an existing application or a new SaaS-based application.

Here is one of the case studies of AWS customer services :

Philips Health Suite Digital Platform Speeds Healthcare Innovation on AWS
PHILIPS is a leading health technology company focused on improving people's health and enabling better outcomes along a continuum from healthy living and prevention to diagnosis, treatment, and home care. Philips leverages advanced technology as well as deep clinical and consumer insights to deliver integrated solutions.

Philips wants to drive out inefficiencies in every aspect of the industry, from prevention to diagnosis, treatment, and home care. To achieve this, Philips is striving to help healthcare providers address the “Quadruple Aim”: improved patient experience, better health outcomes, improved staff experience, and lower cost of care. However, healthcare providers face barriers in their attempts to address the “Quadruple Aim.” For example, regulatory issues and standardization—or lack thereof—can fuel the creation of siloed systems. 


“Hospitals and healthcare systems have traditionally had very disparate architectures with siloed data that they sometimes have trouble sharing internally, much less externally. This complicates everything from improving care to reducing costs to building new software solutions. It can even harm patients.”

Philips has been working for years to help the healthcare industry overcome these challenges through the Philips Health Suite Digital Platform. Philips HealthSuite Digital Platform (HSDP) is an open-source, secure platform of services with a variety of capabilities and tools designed to enable the development of integrated health and wellness solutions. It consolidates patient records, data from wearable or home-based remote medical-monitoring equipment, and information from insurance companies or healthcare organizations.

HSDP—which offers digital services, capabilities, and tools built natively on Amazon Web Services (AWS)—began as a data-exchange network. Its primary function was to create links that consolidate records data from a healthcare provider’s partners and satellite offices with Philips devices designed to help monitor the health of patients at home. Built as a managed service on AWS, it will be able to take advantage of new AWS functions and features including machine learning–based application development and analytics that can not only be deployed in the cloud but also extended on-premises at the edge.

HSDP helps customers improve their efficiency and service quality with services including connections to clinical-grade smart devices, repositories for clinical and device-telemetry data, and a built-in framework to ingest, manage, and analyze healthcare data.On AWS, customers pay for only the resources they need to connect any internal or external customers and partners. They can also build solutions for connected devices and deploy web, enterprise, or customer applications. And, because AWS offers a single programming model for cloud and edge devices that can take advantage of the same robust security services and features, customers can significantly shorten the development lifecycle, reducing costs.

Building HSDP on AWS makes it easier for Philips to compete for healthcare business. “By running the HealthSuite Digital Platform as a managed layer on top of AWS services, it's easier for us to offer a platform that checks all the boxes required in the healthcare space,” says Dijkhoff ,head of HSDP business development at Philips.

Even more important than the dynamic scalability and stability of AWS are the built-in governance capability and proven tools that customers can use to deal with privacy and security issues, rather than building everything themselves. AWS offers the most complete set of cloud services that make it easy to securely deploy and manage edge devices and supports more security standards and compliance certifications than any other provider. “With its many HIPAA-eligible services, strong security tools, and unlimited scalability, AWS helps us differentiate the HealthSuite Digital Platform by enabling us to provide exceptional data security and privacy off the shelf for our customers around the world,” says Wiggins. “The most important thing we have to ensure for HSDP customers is that we get data security and privacy right—and that we do so cost-effectively.”
